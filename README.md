### Hi there I am Rohan! Iâ€™m a Data Science enthusiast who loves to tell stories with data. Iâ€™m also a problem solver who enjoys tackling unstructured problems. When Iâ€™m not working on data projects, you can find me cheering for my favorite football team Chelsea FC.

About this project
This project is a collection of my data science projects. Iâ€™ve included detailed explanations of each project, along with the code and data used to create them. My goal is to showcase my skills as a data scientist and share my passion for data with others. ðŸ‘‹
