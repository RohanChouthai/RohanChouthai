### Hi there I am Rohan! 

### I’m a Data Science enthusiast who loves to tell stories with data. I’m also a problem solver who enjoys tackling unstructured problems. When I’m not working on data projects, you can find me cheering for my favorite football team Chelsea FC.

About this project
This project is a collection of my data science projects. I’ve included detailed explanations of each project, along with the code and data used to create them. My goal is to showcase my skills as a data scientist and share my passion for data with others. 👋
